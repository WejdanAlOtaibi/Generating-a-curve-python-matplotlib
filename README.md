# Generating A Curve

A beginners' project that generates a sin/cos curve 

# Used libraries:

In this project I used:
 - numpy library
     Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays
     It's used for arrays, near algebra, random number capability and many more things in Data Science and Machine Learning
     
 - matplotlib
     Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. It is used along with NumPy to provide an environment that is an effective open source alternative for MatLab
     It's used for plotting graphs, Data Analysis and many more

# matplotlib methods

The matplotlib methods I used in this project are:
 1. plt.plot() 
    plotting the graph
 2. plt.Valuelabel()
    for labelling the values of the graphe, e.g. plt.xlabel("x values")
 3.
